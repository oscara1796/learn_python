Structural Design Patterns
==========================

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They facilitate the design of flexible and efficient software architectures by identifying simple ways to realize relationships among entities. These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change with it.

Below, we delve into the most common structural design patterns, explaining what they are, when to use them, and why they are beneficial.

1\. Decorator Pattern
---------------------

### Definition

The **Decorator Pattern** allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Decorators wrap an object to provide new behaviors while keeping the same interface.

### Why Use the Decorator Pattern

*   **Open/Closed Principle**: It enables extending an object's behavior without modifying existing code, adhering to the principle of being open for extension but closed for modification.
    
*   **Dynamic Behavior**: Allows adding responsibilities to objects at runtime rather than at compile time.
    
*   **Flexible Combination**: Multiple decorators can be combined to add multiple functionalities.
    

### When to Use the Decorator Pattern

*   When you need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
    
*   When subclassing is impractical due to an explosion of subclasses to support every combination of features.
    
*   When you want to avoid cluttering your classes with feature-laden classes that support numerous combinations of behaviors.
    

### Components

*   **Component**: The original object interface that defines the methods.
    
*   **Concrete Component**: The original object that will be decorated.
    
*   **Decorator**: An abstract class or interface that wraps the component and has the same interface.
    
*   **Concrete Decorators**: Classes that extend the decorator and add functionalities.
    

### Real-World Example

Consider a coffee shop where customers can order a basic coffee and customize it with add-ons like milk, sugar, or whipped cream. Instead of creating separate subclasses for each combination, decorators can be used to add these features dynamically.

### Benefits

*   **Extensibility**: New decorators can be added without modifying existing code.
    
*   **Flexibility**: Behaviors can be added or removed at runtime.
    
*   **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator has a specific function, promoting cleaner code.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Complexity**: May result in a large number of small classes.
    
*   **Debugging Difficulty**: Multiple layers of wrapping can make debugging challenging.
    

2\. Facade Pattern
------------------

### Definition

The **Facade Pattern** provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client through which they can access the system.

### Why Use the Facade Pattern

*   **Simplification**: Reduces the complexity of interacting with a system.
    
*   **Decoupling**: Shields clients from the complexity of subsystem components.
    
*   **Ease of Use**: Makes the subsystem easier to use for clients.
    

### When to Use the Facade Pattern

*   When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
    
*   When there are many interdependent classes, and you want to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems.
    
*   When you want to layer your subsystems.
    

### Components

*   **Facade**: The simplified interface that clients use.
    
*   **Subsystem Classes**: The complex components that perform the actual work.
    

### Real-World Example

Think of a home theater system with various components like a DVD player, projector, and sound system. The Facade Pattern can provide a single interface to control all these components, such as "watchMovie()" and "endMovie()".

### Benefits

*   **Improved Readability**: Provides a clear and simple interface.
    
*   **Reduced Dependencies**: Minimizes the coupling between clients and subsystems.
    
*   **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes in the subsystem do not affect clients using the facade.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Over-simplification**: May limit functionality if not designed carefully.
    
*   **Additional Layer**: Introduces an extra layer that might not be necessary for simple systems.
    

3\. Adapter Pattern
-------------------

### Definition

The **Adapter Pattern** allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.

### Why Use the Adapter Pattern

*   **Reusability**: Allows the use of existing classes even if their interfaces don't match the new requirements.
    
*   **Interoperability**: Enables integration with third-party libraries or legacy systems.
    
*   **Flexibility**: Makes unrelated classes work together.
    

### When to Use the Adapter Pattern

*   When you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
    
*   When you need to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
    
*   When you need to use several existing subclasses but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing everyone.
    

### Components

*   **Target Interface**: The interface that clients expect.
    
*   **Client**: The class that interacts with objects using the target interface.
    
*   **Adaptee**: The existing class that needs adapting.
    
*   **Adapter**: Converts the interface of the adaptee into the target interface.
    

### Real-World Example

Suppose you have a new charger that uses a USB-C port, but your laptop only has USB-A ports. An adapter can be used to connect the charger to the laptop, allowing them to work together.

### Benefits

*   **Increased Reusability**: Allows the use of existing functionality.
    
*   **Flexibility**: Supports changing interfaces and integration with third-party code.
    
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps client code clean and focused on its task.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Extra Indirection**: Introduces additional levels of indirection.
    
*   **Complexity**: Can make the overall system more complex if overused.
    

4\. Bridge Pattern
------------------

### Definition

The **Bridge Pattern** decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It separates the objectâ€™s interface (abstraction) from its implementation, allowing both to be modified without affecting each other.

### Why Use the Bridge Pattern

*   **Independent Extension**: Allows both abstractions and implementations to be extended independently.
    
*   **Runtime Binding**: Implementation can be changed at runtime.
    
*   **Reduction of Complexity**: Avoids a proliferation of subclasses resulting from a combinatorial explosion of features.
    

### When to Use the Bridge Pattern

*   When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
    
*   When both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible through subclasses.
    
*   When changes in the implementation should not impact the abstraction.
    

### Components

*   **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to the implementor.
    
*   **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.
    
*   **Implementor**: Defines the interface for implementation classes.
    
*   **Concrete Implementors**: Implement the Implementor interface.
    

### Real-World Example

Consider remote controls (abstractions) and devices like TVs or radios (implementations). The remote control can operate different devices, and devices can be controlled by different remotes, all varying independently.

### Benefits

*   **Flexibility**: Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently.
    
*   **Scalability**: Reduces the number of classes by sharing an implementation among multiple objects.
    
*   **Clear Separation**: Improves the structure by separating responsibilities.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Increased Complexity**: Can add complexity due to the indirection.
    
*   **Over-Engineering**: May not be necessary if the application doesn't require independent variation.
    

5\. Composite Pattern
---------------------

### Definition

The **Composite Pattern** composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Why Use the Composite Pattern

*   **Uniformity**: Simplifies client code by allowing them to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
    
*   **Hierarchical Structures**: Facilitates operations on recursive structures like file systems or organizational charts.
    
*   **Flexibility**: Makes it easy to add new kinds of components.
    

### When to Use the Composite Pattern

*   When you have hierarchical data structures, and you want to be able to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
    
*   When you want clients to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.
    
*   When you need to represent part-whole hierarchies.
    

### Components

*   **Component**: Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
    
*   **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects with no children.
    
*   **Composite**: Represents nodes having children; implements methods to manage child components.
    
*   **Client**: Interacts with objects using the component interface.
    

### Real-World Example

A filesystem where files and directories are organized hierarchically. Directories can contain files or other directories, and operations like "delete" can be performed uniformly on both.

### Benefits

*   **Simplifies Client Code**: Clients can treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
    
*   **Easier to Add New Components**: New types of components can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
    
*   **Represents Complex Hierarchies**: Effectively models tree structures.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Can Be Overgeneralized**: Might make the system overly general.
    
*   **Type Safety**: May make it harder to restrict components of a composite.
    

6\. Flyweight Pattern
---------------------

### Definition

The **Flyweight Pattern** reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing as much data as possible among them. It uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

### Why Use the Flyweight Pattern

*   **Memory Optimization**: Reduces the number of objects created, thus saving memory.
    
*   **Performance Improvement**: Decreases the instantiation overhead.
    
*   **Efficient Data Sharing**: Shares common data among multiple objects.
    

### When to Use the Flyweight Pattern

*   When an application uses a large number of similar objects.
    
*   When the overhead of object creation is high.
    
*   When most object states can be made extrinsic (moved outside the object).
    

### Components

*   **Flyweight**: The shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously.
    
*   **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the Flyweight interface and adds storage for intrinsic state.
    
*   **Flyweight Factory**: Creates and manages flyweight objects.
    
*   **Client**: Maintains references to flyweights and computes extrinsic states.
    

### Real-World Example

In a text editor, each character is represented as an object. Instead of creating a new object for each character, flyweight objects are used to represent common characters, sharing intrinsic state like font or style.

### Benefits

*   **Reduced Memory Usage**: Shares intrinsic state among objects, saving memory.
    
*   **Performance**: Improves performance by reducing object creation.
    
*   **Scalability**: Allows for a large number of objects to exist.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Complexity**: Introduces complexity in the code due to shared states.
    
*   **Synchronization**: Shared objects may require synchronization in multi-threaded environments.
    

7\. Proxy Pattern
-----------------

### Definition

The **Proxy Pattern** provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can add additional functionality when accessing an object, such as lazy initialization, logging, or access control.

### Why Use the Proxy Pattern

*   **Control Access**: Manages access to the real subject.
    
*   **Lazy Initialization**: Delays the creation and initialization of expensive objects until needed.
    
*   **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object in a different address space.
    
*   **Protection Proxy**: Controls access based on permissions.
    

### When to Use the Proxy Pattern

*   When you need a more versatile or sophisticated reference to an object than a simple pointer.
    
*   When you want to add a layer of control over access to an object.
    
*   When you need to perform additional actions whenever an object is accessed.
    

### Components

*   **Subject Interface**: Declares the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy.
    
*   **RealSubject**: The actual object that the proxy represents.
    
*   **Proxy**: Maintains a reference to the RealSubject and controls access to it.
    

### Real-World Example

Consider a large image that takes time to load. Using a proxy, you can display a placeholder image and load the actual image only when it's needed.

### Benefits

*   **Controlled Access**: Provides control over object creation and access.
    
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Adds functionality without changing the real subject's code.
    
*   **Security**: Can enforce access control.
    

### Drawbacks

*   **Overhead**: Adds a layer of indirection that can affect performance.
    
*   **Complexity**: Increases the complexity of the system.

*   **Flyweight Pattern**
    
    *   To reduce memory usage when a large number of similar objects are used.
        
    *   When most of an object's state can be made extrinsic.
        
*   **Proxy Pattern**
    
    *   To provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
